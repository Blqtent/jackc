Choose what you think is the fair BM/h for your skills versus the rest 
of the world.

(in other countries, you are working more than 256 days per year and more
 than 8 hours per day... so the real BM/h for you is even less than that.)

If we make significant amount of money with this software we will pay the
contributors to the ratio of their hours spent.
